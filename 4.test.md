# Run tests with pytest

Scikit-learn developers use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) command line tool to collect the list of all tests written in the scikit-learn source code, execute them and report any failure message.

You can install `pytest` with conda:

```
$ conda install pytest
```

A test is typically written as a Python function with assert statement, for instance:

```python
def test_sum_of_two_integers():
    a = 40
    b = 2
    expected_result = 42
    assert a + b == expected_result
```

Scikit-learn comes with two types of tests:
- common tests, generic tests that every estimator should follow;
- tests specific to each scikit-learn module.

Common tests are stored in the `sklearn/tests` folder. You can run them using:
```
$ pytest sklearn/tests/
```
If you want to run tests on one specific estimator, eg RandomForestClassifier, you can use
```
$ pytest sklearn/tests -k RandomForestClassifier
```

Each sklearn subpackage comes with a `tests` folder that gathers the test files specifically related to it. For instance the folder `sklearn/cluster/tests` holds all the test file written specifically to test clustering algorithms. In particular, `sklearn/cluster/tests/test_k_means.py` is the test file for K-Means clustering algorithm.

Use VSCode to open the source code for the `RandomForestClassifier` class.

- What is the path of this file?
- Can you find the folder that holds the tests for `RandomForestClassifier` in the VSCode file explorer?
- Can you find the test folder and list its content using the `ls` command?
- Locate the file `test_forest.py` in that folder.

Again use the `pwd` command if you are lost.

To run the test
```
$ pytest --verbose ./<path_to_test_folder>/test_forest.py
```

Edit the source code of `RandomForestClassifier` to change the predict method always return 0.
Rerun the test: what do you observe? 

alternatively you can use the `vlx` flags as follows:
```
$ pytest -vlx ./<path_to_test_folder>/test_forest.py
```
Find out about the meaning of those flags with
```
$ pytest --help
```

See also the section [Useful pytest aliases and flags](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/tips.html#useful-pytest-aliases-and-flags) in the scikit-learn documentation.

# Write a new test of your own

We will now do an exercise to add a new test function named `test_rf_regressor_prediction_range` in the `test_forest.py` file.

The goal of this new test will be to check that a `RandomForestRegressor`
never predicts numerical values outside of the range of values observed in
the training set.

The test will use a training set generated at random by [sampling from that
Normal distribution](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html#quick-start).

For a test we can use a small dataset, for instance 100 samples and 10 features.

Here is a code template to get started:

```python
def test_rf_regressor_prediction_range():
    # Create a Random Number Generator with 42 as a fixed seed.
    rng = np.random.RandomState(42)

    # TODO: define the n_samples and n_features variables
    X_train = rng.normal(size=(n_samples, n_features))
    y_train = rng.normal(size=n_samples)

    rfr = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
    rfr.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # TODO: np.min() and np.max() to measure the minimum and
    # maximum values of the training set target values y_train.

    # TODO: generate some random data X_test with the same number
    # of features.

    # TODO: compute the model predictions on the test data:
    # rfr.predict(X_test) and store the results in a variable y_preds.

    # TODO: check that all the values in y_preds lie between the minimum
    # and maximum values of y_train.
```

After each TODO, check that your code works as expected by running only
your test function with the following command:

```
$ pytest -vl -k test_rf_regressor_prediction_range \
     ./<path_to_test_folder>/test_forest.py
```

Bonus exercise: try to modify the code of scikit-learn to make your new test
fail by making it predict very large or very small values.

Note: do not commit those modifications with git.

# Automatically formatting the code with black

It is recommended to format your code with a specific version of `black`:

```
$ conda install black==22.1.0
```

The you can run:

```
$ black path/to/some_file.py
```

or to run it for a full source folder:

```
$ black sklearn/
```

```
$ black examples/
```

and so on.

It's also convenient to run black directly from with-in VS Code:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` and then "> Format Current Document"

and select the `black` formatter the first time your use this command.

# Reverting your changes

Once the exercise is done, feel free to undo all your changes with:

```
git reset --hard
```

# Testing docstrings

`pytest` allows to also test docstrings describing the estimator directly in the source code.
Assuming the `RandomForestClassifier` docstring has been modified, the following command line
is used to test the docstring compliancy:
```
$ pytest --doctest-modules sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py -k RandomForestClassifier
```

# Debugging

If you see an `ImportError` when running `pytest` you might need to re-build the Cython
extensions. You can do this with the command `pip install -v --no-use-pep517 --no-build-isolation -e .`.
On Unix-like systems you can instead also type `make in` from the top-level folder of the project.
